I’m someone who hates drinking Americano. I always add milk to my coffee. Even though I know this makes it hard to appreciate the original flavor of coffee, the idea that “Americano is extremely bitter” remains deeply ingrained in my mind.

My colleague just handed me a cup of coffee and said, “Here’s a strong cup of Americano for you!” I was stunned, and within milliseconds, countless thoughts flashed through my mind: Should I be honest and tell her I don’t drink Americano? Would it be rude to refuse directly? Or should I accept it since she went out of her way to get it for me?

In the end, I took the cup and said thank you.

I went back to my seat and stared at the cup of coffee, feeling a mix of emotions. With some hesitation, I took a sip, and to my surprise, Americano wasn’t that bad! It tasted a bit like tea, with hints of caramel and black tea. I even noticed a sweet aftertaste lingering after each sip.

I’m not sure why I’ve always held the prejudice that “Americano is extremely bitter.” This mindset has made me miss out on opportunities to appreciate pure coffee. In this way, I’ve been limiting myself from experiencing different types of coffee, staying a “latte girl for a thousand years,” content to sit in the corner of the coffee world without ever truly exploring it.

This was a special lesson for me. I let go of my fear and prejudice, all thanks to a cup of Americano.
